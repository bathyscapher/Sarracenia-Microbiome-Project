# Sarracenia Microbiome Project

The protist microcosms in *Sarracenia* species (aka the pitcher plants) are widely used in population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology as model ecosystems across spatiotemporal scales and all levels of biological organization. 
The Sarracenia Microbiome Project analyses the composition of this microbial communities with high-trouphput sequencing and thereby, comparing the microcosms in their native range in Northern America to introduced populations in Europe.
