# Sarracenia Microbiome Project

The protist microcosms in the pitcher-shaped leaves of different [*Sarracenia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia) species (aka the pitcher plants) are widely used as model ecosystems in population biology, community ecology and evolutionary biology.
The Sarracenia Microbiome Project analyses the composition of this microbial communities with high-trouphput sequencing and thereby, comparing the microcosms in their native range in Northern America to introduced populations in Europe.
