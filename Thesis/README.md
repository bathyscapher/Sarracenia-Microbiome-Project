# Community structure in *Sarracenia purpurea* microcosms and adjacent peatlands
This repository contains code to reproduce all analysis in [INSERT THE LINK HERE](www.unifrtheses.ch).

Raw sequences are publicly [available on the servers of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under the accession number PRJNA733308 "Sarracenia microbiome project"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA733308).


## Metadata

## ASV construction
[Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplicon_sequence_variant) were constructed from the raw reads with [dada2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) mainly following the [tutorial](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) and processed with the R package [phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/index.html).
